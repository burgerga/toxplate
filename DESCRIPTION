Title: Create a Plate Layout File to Map Locations to Wells
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Gerhard", "Burger", email = "burger.ga@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Creates a plate layout for your experiment based on the top-left
    and the bottom-right well and a possible zigzag pattern. These layout files can
    be used to match the location (aka 'imageNr') in the image filename to the correct
    well in the plate. The resulting plate layout data can be exported and used in
    'CellProfiler' instead of putting all images in separate well folders.
